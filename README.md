# Machine-Learning-Projects
These are the projects that i have created in the domain of Machine Learning and Deep Learning with the help of few libraries like 
Scikitlearn,matplotlib,keras etc.

1.Breast Cancer Using Keras:I have used keras(using neural networks) to detect whether the breast cancer is malignant or benign.

2.Airline Data Analysis(RNN):Using the concept of RNN to predict how many people are going to travel in an airline within a month.

3.K-Nearest Neighbors:Using KNN to detect whether the breast cancer is malignant or benign,achieved an accuracy of 91%.

4.Movie-Review NLP:
->Predicted whether a movie review is positive or negative
->Eliminated stop words. Used a Lemmatizer in order to stem words. 
->Applied diï¬€erent types of machine learning models like Naive Bayes,Support Vector Machine and Random Forest

5.Naive Bayes: Using naive bayes on Iris dataset to predict the type of flower.

6.PCA-Breast_Cancer & Finding the optimum number of features:Applied Principle componenet analysis in order to reduce the features,
                                                             therefore reducing the size of the data.

7.cifar10_pca_template: Applied PCA on images(CIFAR10 dataset) in order the compress the image size without any signifcant loss of data.
